              Dogs are playful. They love physical activity such as going for
              walks, fetching sticks, leaping into ponds, and racing wildly to
              and fro. Dogs will join you for a jog or for a day in the park or
              even for an exhuberant game of frisbee. Yet dogs can also be soft
              and cuddly and ready at anytime for a loving pat and a reassuring
              hug. They're affectionate and they're soothing to stroke, plus
              most dogs can also remain calm when necessary and be tolerant of
              small children who don't yet know how to be quiet or to behave
              gently around animals.

              It is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
               has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
              when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
              specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
              electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in 
              the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing  passages, 
              and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
